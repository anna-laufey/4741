# ORIE 4741: Risk Factors for Teenage Drinking

Project name: see above.

Collaborators: Anna Halldorsdottir (alh323), Stephanie Hellman (sah346)

Our goal is to identify risk factors for drinking in teenagers. To do this, we will 
examine the student's age, gender, whether they live in an urban or rural area, and their 
success in school, among other factors.

We have a data set of about 700 students from Portugal, all of whom 
took a survey in their math or Portuguese class in the 2005-2006 school year. 
For each student, we have data regarding their family life, social life, education habits, 
grades, and whether or not they drink. We downloaded the data set from Kaggle.com,
